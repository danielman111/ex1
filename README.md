##Ingredients

1.  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan<br />
2.  1 cup sifted cake flour, (not self-rising), plus more for pan<br />
3.  1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />
4.  1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br />
5.  Pinch of ground cloves<br />
6.  1 very ripe large banana, mashed (about 1/2 cup)<br />
7.  1/4 cup buttermilk<br />
8.  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />
9.  1/2 cup firmly packed dark-brown sugar<br />
10.  1 large egg<br />
11.  1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
12.  1/4 teaspoon ground cinammon<br />
13.  1/3 cup chopped toasted pecans<br />
14.  Confectioners' sugar, for dusting<br />
15.  Sweetened whipped cream, for serving (optional)<br />


##Directions

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 6-by-2-inch round cake pan. Line bottom with parchment paper; butter, and dust with flour. Set aside. Into a bowl, sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. In another bowl, whisk banana, buttermilk, and vanilla.

* In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with banana mixture. Stir in pecans. Pour into pan; bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes. Run a knife around edge; invert onto a wire rack. Reinvert cake; let cool. Dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve with whipped cream if desired.
